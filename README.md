# Docker for Python Development

A set of Docker images that copied/modified so I could have a standardized Python development environment across my Mac and Linux machines.

The following is a brief description of the images:
* _python3-base_: Contains a standard Python 3.6 installation, with selected packages for scientific computing, statistics and machine learning.
* _python3-notebook_: Standard Jupyter Notebook (Python 3.6) with some slight modifications and simplifications for the base user and groups.
